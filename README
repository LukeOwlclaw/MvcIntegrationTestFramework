MvcIntegrationTestFramework
===========================

This fork targets MVC 5, VS2015.

Everything should just work out of the box, no need for post build steps.

The example HomeControllerTests should explain everything. I have removed the xunit demo to reduce the number of dependencies. XUnit should still be fully supported.
